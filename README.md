This folder contains different data structures I am learning in my Data Structure class at Boston University.

1) Queues:
  \n· A Queue is a data structure were data in inserted at the end and removed from the other end. 
  As the items are removed in order they arrived, the first to arrive is the first leaving the queue
  is called First-In First-Out (FIFO)
  \n· It is very find Queues in our life, like any waiting line you can imagine for humans, the first
  arriving is the first leaving.
  \n· I created the class Queue.java; however, it is not necessary because java.util already has a class Queue.
